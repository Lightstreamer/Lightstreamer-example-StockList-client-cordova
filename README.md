Lightstreamer StockList Demo Client for PhoneGap
------------------------------------------------

This demo application extends the [PhoneGap Hello World](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-start) application by adding a section that shows some stock quotes from the StockList Demo Adapter and a box that shows the status of the connection to the Lightstreamer Server.


Run The Demo
============

The demo code can be built using the [PhoneGap:Build](https://build.phonegap.com/) website: simply create a new application on the website and point it to the GitHub project to be built.
